##My Powerful Vimrc

There are three version:
* (1) YouCompleteMeVimrc.vim with YouCompleteMe+UltiSnips
* (2) NeocompleteVimrc.vim with neocomplete+clang_complete+Jedi+neosnippet+netsnippet-snippets
* (3) BasicVimrc

(1) use YouCompleteMe + UltiSnips for C/C++/Python auto-complete.

(2) use Neocomplete + clang_complete + Jedi for C/C++/Python auto-complete.

The (1) and (2) are incompatible.

YCM is fast but hints too much, Neo is smooth but need lua support (AFAIK vim-gnome already support lua on many Linux distro).

(3) is only basic vim configuration without plugins.


Besides C/C++/Python auto-complete and snippets, (1) and (2) has many other useful plugins and support many other languages:
* tagbar
* DoxygenToolkit
* solarized
* nerdcommenter
* vim-airline
* indentLine
* ctrlp
* ag
* emment
* css3
* java-compelete2
* phpcomplete
* markdown
* LaTeX
* etc...

Have fun.
